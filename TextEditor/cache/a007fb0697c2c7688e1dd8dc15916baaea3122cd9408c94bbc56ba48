There is a perceived potential threat to coastal India owing to the vast sea-side development and huge populations in the vicinity of the coast. Therefore, there is a pressing need to address issues related to climate stress, adaptation, vulnerability and coping in coastal cities of India, especially from the psychological perspective. Climate change in coastal areas is associated much with flooding, SLR, land inundation, storms, cyclones etc. Coping with and adapting to climate stress are therefore issues of concern for experts worldwide. If environmental stressors persist chronically, they may lead to inner conflicts that can be psychologically disturbing for individuals and may even give rise to physiological, emotional, cognitive and behavioral changes. The established fact that anthropogenic factors account for one of the major contributors to climate chang", "dc.language": "en", "dc.title": "Climate Stress, Behavioral Adaptation and Subjective Well Being in Coastal Cities of India", "prism.publicationdate": "01/23/2014", "citation_firstpage": "13", "citation_abstract_html_url": "http://pubs.sciepub.com/ajap/2/1/3/abstract.html", "dc.date": "01/23/2014", "prism.issn": "2327-6126", "prism.number": "1"}]}, "snippet": "Coastal cities will face great challenges in managing the significant growth in ... \nof the exposure of the world's large port cities to coastal flooding due to storm \nsurge and ....
